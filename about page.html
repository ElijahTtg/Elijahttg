					<h2>About me</h2>
				<p> Hi! I'm Elijah Tan, a Singapore Polytechnic student studying in Diploma in architecture.
					I am excited to embark on a career as an Architect because I am interested in exploring different ways in designing residential buildings that are both sustainable and functional.
					</p>
				<p>
					In my time in Singapore Polytechnic, I participated in various projects and internships which have allowed me to showcase my strengths and skills in  presentation and layout using softwares such as Microsoft PowerPoint and Photoshop. I was also able to showcase my skills in other softwares such as AutoCAD and Sketchup.
					I hope to be able to work with other Architects and achieve career success by gaining the necessary experience in leadership and presentation skills through multiple projects.
